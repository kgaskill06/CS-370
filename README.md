For the TreasureHuntGame, I was given the code that setups the game. This involved the particular files for the game experience and setting up the treasure maze. The code I was tasked to create was the game loop that utilized keras to set up a reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm used deep Q learning to solve the maze.

Computer scientists are important programmers that have particular skillset in solving complex problems. Approaching difficult problems requires an open mind when considering how to approach a problem and its solution. I like to first plan my goal for the code I am about to write and set clear milestones in its development in order to insure I am getting the code to function as intended to my goal. 

Ethical concerns that are most important are the risks of improperly using reinforced learning algorithms that are not properly vetted for hidden biases. Hidden biases in the data can be unintentional or intentional and could cause an ethical dilemea for organziations using these algorithms. Costs to an organization could be unfair treatment or lack of equal opportunities.
